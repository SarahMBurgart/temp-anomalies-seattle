A summation, w/ plots, is available: [Temp-Anomalies-Seattle](http://SarahMBurgart.github.io/temp-anomalies-seattle)

Comparing modern recorded temperature anomalies measured at Boeing Field in Seattle, WA to temperature anomalies from paleo-climatology for the Northern Hemisphere.

Current notebooks compare the change in temperature anomalies and use a MannWhitney test to prove they are not not from the same population.

Currently working on finding a better historical dataset for comparison, isolating seasonal changes to better determine the rate of change of each dataset, and isolate where the changes are the greatest.
