# temp-anomalies-seattle
Comparing modern recorded temperature anomalies measured at Boeing Field in Seattle, WA to temperature anomalies from paleo-climatology.

Current notebooks compare the change in temperature anomalies and prove that they are not not from the same population.

Currently working on isolating seasonal changes to determine the rate of change of each dataset.
